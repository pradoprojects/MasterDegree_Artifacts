In this project, I planned, designed, and conducted an experimental study to characterize and evaluate the cost and strength of structural and functional testing criteria, comparing object-oriented and procedural programs. The contributions of this quantitative research were:
<ul>
  <li>
    Obtaining initial results about the investigated research questions;
  </li>
  <li>
    Artifacts generation for the definition and conduction of further experimental studies;
  </li>
  <li>
    Supporting the training and teaching of software testing activity.
  </li>
