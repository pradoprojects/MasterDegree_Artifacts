# MasterDegree_Artifacts
🐤🐤🐤Artifacts generated during my Master degree at the University of São Paulo - Brazil (USP).

In this project, I planned, designed, and conducted an experimental study to characterize and evaluate the cost and strength of structural and functional testing criteria, comparing object-oriented and procedural programs. The contributions of this quantitative research were: (i)
obtaining initial results about the investigated research questions; (ii) artifacts generation for the definition and conduction of further experimental studies; (iii) supporting the training and teaching of software testing activity.
